This is a Nagios plugin for checking SSHFP records. It checks that
all SSHFP records correspond to a key the server offers, that all keys
the server offers have SSHFP records, and that all SSHFP records are
correct. Incorrect SSHFP records are considered CRITICAL; missing or
superfluous ones are considered WARNING.

In case of WARNING or CRITICAL the SSHFP records that are wrong or
missing are printed to stdout.

Requires Python 3, dnspython, and the ssh-keyscan program. (On Debian,
that means ``python3-dnspython`` and ``openssh-client``.) Currently
happens to work under Python 2 also, but this has not been tested as
extensively.

Here's a ``define command`` stanza for it:

    define command {
      command_name check_sshfp
      command_line /path/to/check_sshfp '$HOSTADDRESS$'
    }
